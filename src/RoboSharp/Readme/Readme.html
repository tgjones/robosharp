								<h1>What is RoboSharp?</h1>
								<p>RoboSharp is a C# port of RoboCode. RoboCode is a Java game that allows robots to
								be designed in Java and then pitted against other robots in a battle. The beauty
								of the RoboCode design is that each robot runs in its own thread and is sandboxed
								so that it cannot interfere with other robots. My RoboSharp implementation uses
								this same architecture, but coded entirely within the .Net framework and using
								as many features as possible from the .Net class libraries.</p>
								<p>The main features of RoboSharp are as follows:
								<ul>
									<li>Built-in Robot Editor that can open, save, and compile robots. One feature
									that was very easy to add in, thanks to .Net, was the ability to choose which language
									the robot is written in - this can be either C# or Visual Basic. Thanks to the dynamic
									compilation abilities of .Net, implementing this editor / compiler was fairly
									straightforward.</li>
									<li>RoboSharp uses the Reflection classes in .Net to load robots dynamically from
									the DLL produced by the Robot Editor.</li>
									<li>The user can select which robots they wish to take part in a particular
									battle. These robots are then each loaded into their own thread and given a timeslice
									(usually 3 milliseconds) in which to update themselves each frame.</li>
									<li>During battles, properties for each robot are shown on the right of the screen
									using a property grid.</li>
									<li>When events such as scanning a robot or hitting a wall are identified, each robot
									receives a notification of this event and can optionally choose to respond to it.</li>
									<li>Each robot can set its own colour. There is, in fact, only one bitmap for the robot,
									but the colour is changed by modulating each pixel colour to achieve the desired colour.</li>
									<li>Collision detection between robots and robots, and between robots and bullets.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								
								<h1>Loading RoboSharp</h1>
								<p>RoboSharp can be loaded by double-clicking on RoboSharp.exe in the Executable folder.</p>
								
																<h1>Why RoboSharp?</h1>
								<p>I wrote RoboSharp to show that C# and GDI+ are a viable platform for 2D games. As a side-effect,
								RoboSharp also shows that .Net is more flexible than Java - for instance, the ability to use either
								Visual Basic or C# to program robots.</p>
								<h1>Writing Your Own Robot</h1>
								<p>To write your own robot, load the Robot Editor by clicking on Robot > Editor in the main menu.
								The easiest way to proceed would be to open one of the sample robots. These are in the Executable\Robots folder.</p>
